# PyBer_Analysis
### Module 5 : Pyber_Challenge
#### Pyber Challenge includes 'PyBer_Challenge.ipynb' & 'PyBer_Challenge figure' in the 'Analysis' folder
  
  Data shows that the average metrics are inverse proportional to the total metrics. In the summary dataframe, 'Urban' cities have the highest figures for each category but lower in average compared to other two city types. Which can be concluded as bigger market having lower outcomes for each driver and how fierce their competition would be. 'Rural' cities have the least total number of rides and drivers but the average fare for both consumers and drivers are high. There would be better satisfaction among drivers but in this case they might be needed to seek for customers for higher performance or longer average working hour in general due to diffrent persepective of competition than the 'Urban' cities where they have higher population and the way of competing is reversed. 
  
  In the figure, all three lines seems to fluctuate together on the same time periods. Which could mean that there are specific moments in each month where the ride-sharing system is in high demand than the rest. Regardless of how the population is for each city type, total fares seems stable enough not to spike up and down extremly. 
  Gathering future data and running a similar analysis would seem necessary to determine the right path to evolve current ride-share system for more success in business.
