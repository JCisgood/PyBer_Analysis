# PyBer_Analysis
### Pyber_Challenge
Pyber Challenge includes 'PyBer_Challenge.ipynb' & 'PyBer_Challenge figure' in the 'Analysis' folder
  Summary_df shows that average metrics are inverse proportional to total metrics.
  In the figure, as how each city type's total fare shakes quite a bit as it goes by month, the lines indicate that it looks more stable when the total fare amount is low.
